# Test plan for PROC CODEIT enhancement

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this test plan is to define the overall strategy for testing the enhancement to the `DO statement` in PROC CODEIT. This plan provides:
- A structured framework for designing and executing the tests
- Coverage of functional, boundary, error-handling, and performance scenarios
- Criteria for evaluating the readiness of the enhancement

### 1.2 Project Overview

PROC CODEIT currently supports the following syntax for the `DO statement`:

```
DO index = start TO stop;
	<statement-list>
END;
```

The index variable always increments by 1.

A customer requested an enhancement to introduce an optional `BY increment` clause, allowing the user to specify a custom step value:

```
DO index = start TO stop BY increment;
	<statement-list>
END;
```

This enhancement provides greater flexibility in the looping for PROC CODEIT.

## 2. Scope

### 2.1 In scope

- Numeric ranges with positive/negative/fractional increments
- Termination at boundaries
- Error handling and diagnostics 
- Behavior when start > stop with positive increment (0 iterations), and vice versa
- Nested loops
- Large iteration counts 

### 2.2 Out of scope 

- Non-DO statements: IF, WHILE, and other statements are not affected and are covered by existing regression testing.
- Cross-product compatibility: The scope is limited to validating syntax and execution inside PROC CODEIT.
- Integration with external data sources: The `BY increment` feature is internal to PROC CODEIT.
- Security testing: This enhancement does not introduce new user inputs or external integrations.

## 3. Test Approach

- Functional Testing: Verify core functionality of `BY increment`.
- Boundary Testing: Test edges of input ranges.
- Error Handling: Ensure meaningful errors for invalid syntax.
- Performance Testing: Verify loop efficiency and stability under extreme circumstances.
- Regression Testing: Verify no bugs introduced into existing `DO statement` functionality.

- P3 = Performance and Discovery tests  

## 5. Assumptions / Risks

### 5.1 Assumptions

- `BY increment` accepts fractional values. Loop termination allows for minor floating-point rounding differences when comparing to the stop value.
- Default increment: If `BY increment` is omitted, the increment = 1.
- Termination rules:
  - For positive increments: loop runs while index <= stop.
  - For negative increments: loop runs while index >= stop.
- If the index would overshoot the stop, the loop does not execute that iteration. After termination, the index retains the last executed value.
- Zero increment is invalid and will throw an error.
- Start/stop/increment are numeric values (integers, floating-point literals, scientific notation). Non-numeric increments will throw an error.
- Index visibility: index is readable inside the loop. Behavior when modifying the index is implementation-dependent.
- Nested DO statements are allowed.
- If start == stop, loop runs exactly once.
- Start/stop/increment may be specified as literals or variables. Behavior is consistent for both cases.

### 5.2 Risks

- Increment logic may not handle floating-point precision correctly.
- Index modification inside body may cause unexpected skips or repeats.
- Very large start/stop ranges or very small `BY` increments may surface performance issues. 
- Zero increment could cause an infinite loop.
- Ambiguous errors (like "invalid loop") could slow triage.

## 6. Test Data 

- Representative test data (small/large, positive/negative, edge/error cases) is described within the Test Scenarios in section 4.
- No separate test data files required. Scenario definitions contain needed data.

## 7. Deliverables

- Test Plan Document
- Test Cases 
- Test Results Report (summary of executed tests, pass/fail status, and any defects)

## 8. Example Test Case 

Test Case ID: TC-11
- Objective: Verify that the DO loop correctly handles a positive integer increment value.
- Test Scenario: Loop from a lower value to a higher value with a positive integer increment. Use start/stop/by values that are stored as variables.

```
// Setup
Create an empty list called result_list
Set start = 1
Set stop = 10
Set step = 2

// Execute the loop
PROC CODEIT;
	DO index = start TO stop BY step;
		Add index to result_list
	END;
QUIT;

// Expected result
expected_output = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]

// Verify
IF result_list equals expected_output
	PRINT "TEST PASSED: Positive integer increment test passed."
ELSE
	PRINT "TEST FAILED: Positive integer increment test failed."
	PRINT "Expected: " + expected_output
	PRINT "Actual: " + result_list
ENDIF
```

## 9. Exit Criteria

- All planned test cases executed.
- 100% pass rate on P1 test cases. 
- No critical severity defects outstanding.
